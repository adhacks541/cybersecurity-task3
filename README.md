## Objective
Use Nessus Essentials to perform a vulnerability scan on my local machine.

## Tool Used
- Nessus Essentials (free community version)

## Target
- Localhost (127.0.0.1)

## Steps Performed
1. Installed Nessus and activated with a free license.
2. Set up a basic scan targeting my machine.
3. Allowed the scan to run (~45 minutes).
4. Reviewed the report and documented critical vulnerabilities.
5. Took screenshots of the dashboard and results.

## Sample Vulnerabilities Found
